# ATM Machine Project

Welcome to the ATM Machine Project! This Java project simulates an ATM machine using Object-Oriented Programming concepts. Users can log in with their customer number and PIN to access checking and saving accounts, view balances, withdraw funds, and deposit funds.

## Features

- Secure login using customer number and PIN.
- Access checking and saving accounts.
- View account balances.
- Withdraw funds from checking and saving accounts.
- Deposit funds into checking and saving accounts.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/atm-machine-project.git


1. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

2. Run the Main.java class to start the ATM simulation.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to log in, select an account type, and perform transactions.

## Account Information

For testing purposes, the project includes the following account numbers and PINs:

Customer Number: 952141, PIN: 191904
Customer Number: 989947, PIN: 71976

## Object-Oriented Design

This project follows a modular design using classes and inheritance:

1. The Account class stores account details and balances.
2. The OptionMenu class handles user interactions and menu options, inheriting from the Account class.
3. The Main class initializes the OptionMenu and starts the ATM simulation.
